              In the United Kingdom, individuals facing homelessness have specific legal rights protected by law. 
              Understanding these rights is crucial for accessing the support and services you're entitled to receive.

              The Housing Act 1996, as amended by the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, provides a framework of rights 
              designed to prevent homelessness and support those already experiencing it. Local authorities have 
              legal duties to assist you, depending on your circumstances.
